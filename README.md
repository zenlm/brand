## Core Brand Identity

### Mission
Building ultra-efficient language models that deliver frontier performance while remaining accessible to researchers, developers, and organizations of all sizes.

### Vision
A world where powerful language models are not limited to massive tech companies with enormous compute budgets, but available to anyone with creative ideas.

### Values
- **Efficiency**: Maximum performance per parameter and compute unit
- **Accessibility**: Models deployable on consumer hardware
- **Elegance**: Clean architectures without unnecessary complexity
- **Precision**: Careful optimization and empirical validation
- **Mindfulness**: Thoughtful design inspired by Zen philosophy

## Brand Positioning

**Target Audience**:
- ML researchers and engineers
- Startups and small companies
- Independent developers
- Academic institutions
- Edge computing applications

**Key Differentiators**:
- 600M-480B parameter range covering all use cases
- Fusion architecture combining ~100 frontier LLMs
- Co-developed by Hanzo AI and Zoo Labs
- Optimized for inference efficiency
- Open source with permissive licensing

## Visual Identity

### Logo Philosophy
The Zen LM logo embodies simplicity, balance, and enlightenment. Purple represents wisdom and creativity, while minimalist design reflects the efficiency philosophy.

### Color System
- **Royal Purple** (`#9B59B6`): Wisdom, creativity, premium quality
- **Deep Purple** (`#8E44AD`): Depth, sophistication, technical excellence
- **Pink Accent** (`#E91E63`): Energy, modernity, accessibility

### Typography
- **Inter**: Modern, geometric sans-serif for clarity and readability
- **JetBrains Mono**: Technical documentation and model outputs

## Usage Guidelines

### Do's ✅
- Use "Zen LM" (capital L, capital M)
- Emphasize efficiency and accessibility
- Highlight Qwen3/Qwen-Next foundation (not Qwen2)
- Reference co-development with Hanzo AI and Zoo Labs
- Link to zenlm.ai as primary web presence

### Don'ts ❌
- Don't call it "Zen AI" or "ZenAI"
- Don't use "ZenLM" (missing space)
- Don't claim Qwen2 heritage (we use Qwen3+)
- Don't modify the minimal logo design
- Don't use bright or loud color schemes

## Model Family

### Size Range
- **Zen Nano** (600M): Ultra-lightweight, edge deployment
- **Zen Small** (1.5B): Consumer hardware optimized
- **Zen Base** (7B): Balanced performance/efficiency
- **Zen Large** (70B): High capability, efficient inference
- **Zen Ultra** (480B): Frontier performance

### Architecture
- **Foundation**: Fusion of ~100 frontier LLMs
